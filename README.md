## Budget tracking application

### *Project Proposal*
The budget tracking application will be designed to effectively help individuals/families manage and track their expenses in an organised manner.There will be three key features in this application:
- **Categorized spending**: Account for spendings being made in one's daily life such as grocery, entertainment, bills, and recurring subscription payments.

- **Spending Limits**: It will allow users to set limits on the amount of money that should be spent in each category. Additionally, it will also send out alerts to users when they are near/exceeding this amount. 

- **Generate reports**: Towards the end of every month the budget tracker should generate a report summarizing spending on each category, checking if financial goals were met.

This project is of particular interest to me since it can be a very helpful tool to many college students/individuals like myself who often need to manage tight budgets and keep track of various expenses. This application may help users make informed decisions about their spending, ultimately leading to healthier financial habits.
